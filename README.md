# Code Setup

The code can be setup in your favorite code editor. Follow instructions to set it up

## Instructions

* Install Java 11 to setup the code - Code uses Java 11 syntax for the existing code
* Project includes a `gradlew` binary to install gradle locally as needed to manage dependencies
* JUnit 5 - Project uses Junit 5 tests
* `git clone https://github.com/sahajsoft/parking-lot.git`
* Open in a code editor. We prefer [IntelliJ Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=mac), but other code editors that you are comfortable with should work as well. 
* Execute JUnit tests in code editor or command line `./gradlew test`
* All but one test should pass. Currently `shouldUnParkAndUnParkFixedNumberOfCars` test fails. 
* As long as you have reached this point, you are ready to start pairing
